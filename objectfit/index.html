            <p>In just a few weeks, the American withdrawal from northern Syria dramatically reordered power in the country after eight years of civil war.</p>

            <p>Here’s how Syria looked three weeks ago: <span class="green">American-backed Kurds</span> controlled the northeast, while the <span class="blue">Syrian government</span> controlled most of the rest.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Turkish forces</span> were already in northwest Syria, but Turkey had long wanted to establish a roughly <span class="green">20-mile-deep buffer</span> along the whole border. It sees the Kurdish-led forces there as terrorists.</p>

            <p>But those same Kurdish-led forces were fighting alongside the United States against ISIS. Roughly <span class="red">1,000 American troops</span> were positioned across bases and outposts in northern Syria — including two bases near the Turkish
                border.

            <p>On Oct. 6, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called President Trump and said Turkey would invade. Mr. Trump immediately ordered <span class="red">troops to withdraw</span> from those two bases — allowing Turkey to move in and changing years of
                American policy.</p>

            <p>Abandoned by the United States, the Kurds had few options. In a dramatic shift, they made a deal with an American enemy — the <span class="blue">Syrian government</span>. The partnership opened the door for President Bashar al-Assad to try
                to regain control of the whole country.</p>

            <p>As Americans continued to evacuate their bases, the United States signed a cease-fire deal with Turkey that demanded Kurdish forces leave the area where <span class="yellow">Turkey was advancing</span>. The deal essentially gave American assent

            <p>Five days later, Russia and Turkey divided up northern Syria: Turkey got the <span class="yellow">area it had captured</span> and a promise that the Kurds would push back 20 miles. Russia and Mr. al-Assad got the rest. It’s unclear what will
                happen with <span class="green">the land the Kurds still control</span>.</p>

            <p>The changing landscape also threw a wrench into U.S. plans targeting the ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The U.S. had to speed up the raid, and the Kurds, feeling betrayed, suspended their crucial security cooperation. <span class="orange">Al-Baghdadi was killed </span>despite
